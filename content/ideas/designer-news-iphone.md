## Introducing Designer News for the iPhone.

Nothing more, nothing less but the full DN experience.

## Scroll, tap and swipe.

Gimmick-free interface not just for designers, and that's a good thing.

## Content that fits.

One of the few entries that feature landscape orientation.

PS: This isn't the official DN app. It's my entry for the _[Design+Code Giveaway](https://news.layervault.com/stories/19416-designcode-giveaway)_ contest organized by [LayerVault](https://layervault.com). I started using LayerVault because of this contest and I have to say it's much better suited for a design workflow than Dropbox. I probably won't be switching because I have just too much space on Dropbox. Early adopter bonuses you see.
