Here's a way to multiple types of navigation bars using a single symbol in Sketch app. It saves me lots of time and should do the same for you.

I have three symbols. The back button and status bar symbols are standard. The important one is the navigation bar symbol. Look at the layer list and you will see I have included various labels for left and right items, done item and two types of titles/subtitle.

The trick to showing and hiding the correct labels is using a `SPACE` as value in symbol overrides for labels to be hidden.

Easy and of course it also works for other kinds of symbols.
