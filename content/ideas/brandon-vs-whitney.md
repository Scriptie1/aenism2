After being busy with client work for a while I'm back writing and at the same time I wanted to renew the site with a simpler and more fluid design, and a new font to go with the format.

I narrowed down to [Brandon Text](http://hvdfonts.com/#189-Brandon%20Text) by HvD and [Whitney](http://www.typography.com/fonts/whitney/overview/) by Hoefler & Co. and decidedly chose the former.

Originally developed for New Yorkâ€™s Whitney Museum, Whitney is utilitarian, safe and solemn. It's a perfect typeface for institutions and serious publications. Unfortunately this also made it boring. The letterforms are so upright that a Whitney paragraph resembles a regimented military parade. Brandon Text, on the other hand is relaxed and livelier, without appearing playful. If Whitney is as described by Hoefler, an extroverted typeface then Brandon would be friendly and warm.

Is Whitney the new Trajan?
