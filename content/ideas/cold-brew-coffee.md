Regular coffee messes with my brain. I only drink coffee as a last resort. When I have to turn in code which I already know how to write and I only have to stay awake and type like a zombie on auto-pilot. Coffee rarely helps when I need to also be creative because I always end up making crap because zombies aren't very creative.

It's mostly the caffeine overload. Perhaps I'm just too sensitive. I tried tea but the teas I like â€“ green and rooibos don't give me any buzz and I don't like the astringent taste of black tea. Japanese Matcha is one of my favorites but the good ones that don't taste like powdered grass are expensive.

I needed something with the buzz between coffee and tea, which would taste good without sugar, easy on the wallet and light enough as an everyday beverage. Then I discovered cold brew coffee.

Cold coffee is coffee that is brewed with room temperature or cold water for extended time to a similar strength as coffee brewed with hot water. Hot water causes coffee to release undesirable acidic oils. This is why conventional wisdom is to brew coffee with water not hotter than 90 degrees celsius. Even then some acidity is to be expected as long as there's heat. The heat also draws out the caffeine molecules much faster. The result is really a cup of heartburn-inducing bad-tasting caffeine soup. Face it. Most people don't like the taste of coffee the first time. It's an acquired taste and it's probably the addictive stimulant effects you have acquired, not the taste. Better coffee would be something that's less like caffeine-junkie dope and tastes better. Cold coffee is exactly that. Plus because cold coffee doesn't have to deal with the compound [_2-furfurylthiiol_](http://pubs.acs.org/email/cen/html/092007130322.html) which degrades as heated coffee cools off, it actually stays fresh longer. You can just make two weeks worth in a big jug without it going stale.

## What you need

* Coffee beans (coarse ground)
* Nut milk bag bag or cheese cloth
* Water jug
* Refrigerator (optional)

Put ground coffee beans in a drawstring cloth bag with a mesh fine enough to filter out the grounds, put it in a jug filled with water then seep it overnight in the fridge. Half a cup of grounds to every liter of water works fine. Adjust the amount of grounds or the seeping time for stronger or weaker coffee. I prefer my coffee cold but the fridge is optional.
