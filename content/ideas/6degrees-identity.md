I've recently starting working with the [6degrees](http://web.sixdegreez.co) team. 6degrees is founded by Niranjan Rao (CEO) and Arun Samudrala (CTO) who are based in Bangalore – India's very own silicon valley. 6degrees is a _self-updating phonebook that automatically cleans duplicates and backs itself up_. We currently have an [Android app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=co.abhriya.sixdegreez) and an iOS version is in the works. I will be involved in the design of both apps moving forward.

The first thing we did was to refresh the identity. Here's the logo as a animated buildup to its final shapes showing the underlying geometry.

6degrees is named after the [popular theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six_degrees_of_separation) originally set out by Frigyes Karinthy and popularized by a play written by John Guare – _that everyone and everything is six or fewer steps away, by way of introduction, from any other person in the world_. This, in essence is what 6degrees is all about – to be a network of contacts where everyone is connected in some way.

The mathematical constructs in the logo's geometrical form are:

* Continuity
* Hexagon
* Equilaterals

### Continuity

Instead of placing the degree symbol in an arbitrary position. I used the ascender of the 6 as the guide and placed it along the outer curve.

The counter of the 6 is also placed in the same continuum as the ascender in a configuration similar to the Large Hadron Collider which accelerates protons from the smaller circle into the large circle.

### Hexagon

Being six-sided, the hexagon is the perfect polygon to communicate the concept of _six degrees of separation_. The hexagon is also one of the most efficient shapes in nature. Bees instinctinctively construct their hives as three-dimensional hexagons because they make for robust stuctures that cost the least wax. Since 6degrees is very much about maintaining a clean and efficient contact list, having a hexagonal frame makes sense.

Graphite is made up of layers of graphene, each a single atom thick. In graphene carbon atoms are arranged in a hexagonal grid. Carbon nanotubes which are essentially rolled up tubes of graphene owe their strength to this hexagonal nature.

### Equilaterals

Hexagons have internal angles of 720&deg;. Each vertice is 120&deg;. A hexagon can be sliced into six equilateral triangles. Each one can be half into two right-angle triangles. Overlaying the hexagon over the outer circle I broke it into twelve equal parts.

The four equal segments of the top-left quadrant of the cake determines the the symmetry of the 6 and the distance from the terminal to the degree symbol. This manner of constructing the 6 feels stable and balanced. As a result the 6 despite being heavier on its left side stays in equilibrium because of its attachment to the degree symbol.

By now you should be able to tell that I have a fetish for [geometrical](https://www.quora.com/Is-it-important-for-designers-to-know-math-and-science/answer/Aen-Tan) typographical [forms](http://drbl.in/bedt).
