      <description>Here&amp;rsquo;s a way to multiple types of navigation bars using a single symbol in Sketch app. It saves me lots of time and should do the same for you.
 I have three symbols. The back button and status bar symbols are standard. The important one is the navigation bar symbol. Look at the layer list and you will see I have included various labels for left and right items, done item and two types of titles/subtitle.</description>

      <title>Fear, regression and creativity</title>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s scary to be a child. We start off as helpless infants totally dependent on our caretakers. As soon as we leave the safety of our mothers&amp;rsquo; wombs, we had to start getting used to fears and anxieties as the world unfolds itself in ever increasing complexity.
I remember a nightmare when i was three, the frightening image of a top hat-wearing skull woke me from sleep. It might have been Baron Samedi but I have never seen him as a child.</description>

      <title>Brandon vs Whitney</title>

      <description>After being busy with client work for a while I&amp;rsquo;m back writing and at the same time I wanted to renew the site with a simpler and more fluid design, and a new font to go with the format.
I narrowed down to Brandon Text by HvD and Whitney by Hoefler &amp;amp; Co. and decidedly chose the former.
Brandon Text and Whitney Comparison Originally developed for New York’s Whitney Museum, Whitney is utilitarian, safe and solemn.</description>

      <description>Introducing Designer News for the iPhone. Nothing more, nothing less but the full DN experience.
 Scroll, tap and swipe. Gimmick-free interface not just for designers, and that&amp;rsquo;s a good thing.
 Content that fits. One of the few entries that feature landscape orientation.
  PS: This isn&amp;rsquo;t the official DN app. It&amp;rsquo;s my entry for the Design+Code Giveaway contest organized by LayerVault. I started using LayerVault because of this contest and I have to say it&amp;rsquo;s much better suited for a design workflow than Dropbox.</description>

      <description>Update: I received a complaint from Adobe stating this article is violating the DMCA and is requiring the entire article be taken down. It&amp;rsquo;s absurd. I&amp;rsquo;m not even sure if this workaround works anymore. In good faith I have edited some of the text.
I have a Typekit subscription and have full access to all their fonts. Adobe also recently introduced the ability to sync fonts to the desktop via Creative Cloud for use in mockups, print design and word processing.</description>

      <title>Good taste</title>

      <description>The widely accepted notion of taste is of a sociological concept defined as a person&amp;rsquo;s personal and cultural patterns of preference. Of what looks good and what is cool. Is there an objective measure of beauty? How does taste work?
Taste or more accurately aesthetic taste is emotional. It&amp;rsquo;s the ability to discern the pleasant and the polar opposite of the emotion of disgust. Like the other senses, we perceive pleasance, beauty and goodness as sensory signals.</description>

      <description>Imagine.
You are in an empty white room. Just you in a stark, small empty space. With nothing to do, nothing to entertain yourself with. You fall asleep eventually only to wake up to the same bleakness as before.
Imagine.
Now an empty notebook appears in front of you. Then a pencil.
You now have something to do. You are not bored anymore. Having some writing/drawing materials makes a big difference.</description>

      <description>How can you swap the top textbox with the bottom textbox so you ensure the space between the two textboxes remain the same like this?
 Here&amp;rsquo;s the layer structure:
 First, put the two textboxes in a group so they can be vertically center-aligned against the background rectangle.
Then follow these steps.

      <title>Cold brew coffee</title>

      <description>Regular coffee messes with my brain. I only drink coffee as a last resort. When I have to turn in code which I already know how to write and I only have to stay awake and type like a zombie on auto-pilot. Coffee rarely helps when I need to also be creative because I always end up making crap because zombies aren&amp;rsquo;t very creative.
It&amp;rsquo;s mostly the caffeine overload. Perhaps I&amp;rsquo;m just too sensitive.</description>

      <description>In this article I&amp;rsquo;ll discuss an experimental redesign of a fashion product page from Uniqlo Japan&amp;rsquo;s online shopping website. I imagined how the site would be like a couple of years from now. View the demo
 I’ve been wearing American Apparel T-shirts for years and recently switched to Uniqlo when I was finally able to fit into a Japanese size L after losing weight. Uniqlo is much cheaper than AA and I can just buy them in town than pay shipping fees.</description>

      <description>Nuon is a curious boy. He got it from me. I remember on the day he was born, I was carrying tiny Nuon in my arms as I showed him around the room my wife was staying in. I pointed at various objects and his already keen eyes followed my finger around. There was a glow in his eyes. “Wow” I thought, “he’s going to be an explorer!”
And he is.</description>

      <description>The blobby shapes you see in the 37signals logo. They are called metaballs. It&amp;rsquo;s not a typo. You can&amp;rsquo;t eat them.
37signals logo It&amp;rsquo;s a common pattern in logos. The metaball shape is actually very easy to create in any vector software. Here&amp;rsquo;s how to do it in Illustrator using basic shapes and the Pathfinder tool.</description>

      <description>If you do creative work like me you would find the following videos helpful. I&amp;rsquo;ve grouped them to make it easier for you to choose what you want to watch but I recommend you watch all of them.
Personal growth Growing as a designer is like growing up as a person. To become better at something is to take heed from those who have done it. One of the most important advice I had came from this video interview of Ira Glass.</description>

      <description>I first came across pjax (pushState + ajax) when I was working on a Rails 4 project which has Turbolinks. Turbolinks isn&amp;rsquo;t pjax per se. It&amp;rsquo;s similar and based on the same philosophy.
How pjax works Instead of re-rendering a full page on every page request, pjax fetches only a fragment of the target page and uses that to replace its counterpart in the current DOM, thereby preserving the surrounding layout, scripts and style.</description>

      <description>Human communication progresses in three primary dimensions – relation, distance and fidelity. Relation is about how we are connected. The simplest network is a direct line between two nodes. A face-to-face (one-to-one) dialog for example. A speech is one-to-many. A campfire is many-to-many. With the Morse code, we conquered distance. The telephone allowed us to converse with somebody far away as if he was near. The internet grew similarly. Email started as one-to-one.</description>

      <description>Mark Otto merged my first pull request into Bootstrap. Just some additional CSS to add previously unsupported button dropdowns to justified button groups. Here&amp;rsquo;s a demo.
 If you are using Bootstrap &amp;gt; v3.0.3 it has five lines of my code in it!</description>

      <description>The Riddle Consider this riddle I found spread­ing on Face­book some while ago.
 This problem can be solved by children in five to ten minutes, programmers in an hour and people with higher education…

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s still January, not too late to add having a new blog to my resolutions. My last decently successful blog aentan.com lasted just under three years. I made it to the Hacker News front page a couple of times, reposted an article to Lifehacker and landed various job opportunities. Problem was… maintaining a WordPress site in a shared hosting environment is annoying. Dreamhost was a hundred bucks a year. Didn&amp;rsquo;t make sense anymore.</description>
