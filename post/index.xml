      <description>We are seeing increasingly advanced AI and robotics coming out of labs all around the world. I first saw ASIMO in the late 1990s and QRIO in the early 2000s, I was amazed by robotic bipedalism. Twenty years forward, though we are seeing much better locomotion and facial expressions are starting to look a little less creepy and we are definitely in a robotic age, I believe we are still at its dawn.</description>

      <description>Search for health app ui on pinterest and you will find 9 of 10 examples use a white/cyan color scheme, have minimalistic graphs and beautifully type-set numbers, but not a lot of human.
I refuse to accept the sterile sci-fi fantasy aesthetic. It is dehumanizing. I remember walking around in Tokyo and seeing their marketing, ads and graphic design on trains, the street and publications, they are so full of positivity.</description>

      <description>Content Highlights 38 spots around the city, including the best tea shop in Chinatown, a mini-park 11 stories in the air, a private library, and a bunch of amazing restaurants.
Construction The map is printed on waterproof tear-resistant Tyvek. It&amp;rsquo;s then folded up using an origami technique that allows it to smoothly open and close in one motion, and makes it impossible to misfold.
Manufacturing Info The map is printed by Yushin-Plus, an art printing company in Tokyo, and folded by the Miura-Ori Lab, also in Tokyo.</description>

      <description>6degrees Initially available on Android and now on iOS, 6degrees is a self-updating phonebook that automatically cleans duplicates and backs itself up. One of the first things I did for 6degrees was to refresh their identity.
6degrees is named after the popular theory originally set out by Frigyes Karinthy and popularized by a play written by John Guare – that everyone and everything is six or fewer steps away, by way of introduction, from any other person in the world.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s scary to be a child. We start off as helpless infants totally dependent on our caretakers. As soon as we leave the safety of our mothers&amp;rsquo; wombs, we had to start getting used to fears and anxieties as the world unfolds itself in ever increasing complexity.
I remember a nightmare when i was three, the frightening image of a top hat-wearing skull woke me from sleep. It might have been Baron Samedi but I have never seen him as a child.</description>

      <title>Good Taste</title>

      <description>The widely accepted notion of taste is of a sociological concept defined as a person&amp;rsquo;s personal and cultural patterns of preference. Of what looks good and what is cool. Is there an objective measure of beauty? How does taste work?
Taste or more accurately aesthetic taste is emotional. It&amp;rsquo;s the ability to discern the pleasant and the polar opposite of the emotion of disgust. Like the other senses, we perceive pleasance, beauty and goodness as sensory signals.</description>

      <description>Imagine.
You are in an empty white room. Just you in a stark, small empty space. With nothing to do, nothing to entertain yourself with. You fall asleep eventually only to wake up to the same bleakness as before.
Imagine.
Now an empty notebook appears in front of you. Then a pencil.
You now have something to do. You are not bored anymore. Having some writing/drawing materials makes a big difference.</description>

      <description>In this article I&amp;rsquo;ll discuss an experimental redesign of a fashion product page from Uniqlo Japan&amp;rsquo;s online shopping website. I imagined how the site would be like a couple of years from now. View the demo
I’ve been wearing American Apparel T-shirts for years and recently switched to Uniqlo when I was finally able to fit into a Japanese size L after losing weight. Uniqlo is much cheaper than AA and I can just buy them in town than pay shipping fees.</description>

      <description>Nuon is a curious boy. He got it from me. I remember on the day he was born, I was carrying tiny Nuon in my arms as I showed him around the room my wife was staying in. I pointed at various objects and his already keen eyes followed my finger around. There was a glow in his eyes. “Wow” I thought, “he’s going to be an explorer!”
And he is.</description>

      <description>The blobby shapes you see in the 37signals logo. They are called metaballs. It&amp;rsquo;s not a typo. You can&amp;rsquo;t eat them.
It&amp;rsquo;s a common pattern in logos. The metaball shape is actually very easy to create in any vector software. Here&amp;rsquo;s how to do it in Illustrator using basic shapes and the Pathfinder tool.</description>

      <description>If you do creative work like me you would find the following videos helpful. I&amp;rsquo;ve grouped them to make it easier for you to choose what you want to watch but I recommend you watch all of them.
Personal growth Growing as a designer is like growing up as a person. To become better at something is to take heed from those who have done it. One of the most important advice I had came from this video interview of Ira Glass.</description>

      <description>I first came across pjax (pushState + ajax) when I was working on a Rails 4 project which has Turbolinks. Turbolinks isn&amp;rsquo;t pjax per se. It&amp;rsquo;s similar and based on the same philosophy.
How pjax works Instead of re-rendering a full page on every page request, pjax fetches only a fragment of the target page and uses that to replace its counterpart in the current DOM, thereby preserving the surrounding layout, scripts and style.</description>

      <description>Human communication progresses in three primary dimensions – relation, distance and fidelity. Relation is about how we are connected. The simplest network is a direct line between two nodes. A face-to-face (one-to-one) dialog for example. A speech is one-to-many. A campfire is many-to-many. With the Morse code, we conquered distance. The telephone allowed us to converse with somebody far away as if he was near. The internet grew similarly. Email started as one-to-one.</description>

      <description>The Riddle Consider this riddle I found spread­ing on Face­book some while ago.
This problem can be solved by children in five to ten minutes, programmers in an hour and people with higher education…
