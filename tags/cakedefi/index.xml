      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been busy working with various startup in the five years since my last post. I joined Cake DeFi in 2019, after being hired by one of its co-founders to lead the design effort. Lots have happened since, which I will talk about in future posts. I&amp;rsquo;d like to share an interesting project that I recently completed â€“ to redesign its logo, as part of a larger brand identity refresh we did in collaboration with Aleph Labs.</description>
