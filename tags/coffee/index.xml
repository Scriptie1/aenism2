      <description>Regular coffee messes with my brain. I only drink coffee as a last resort. When I have to turn in code which I already know how to write and I only have to stay awake and type like a zombie on auto-pilot. Coffee rarely helps when I need to also be creative because I always end up making crap because zombies aren&amp;rsquo;t very creative.
It&amp;rsquo;s mostly the caffeine overload. Perhaps I&amp;rsquo;m just too sensitive.</description>
