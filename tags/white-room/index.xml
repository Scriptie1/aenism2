      <description>Imagine.
You are in an empty white room. Just you in a stark, small empty space. With nothing to do, nothing to entertain yourself with. You fall asleep eventually only to wake up to the same bleakness as before.
Imagine.
Now an empty notebook appears in front of you. Then a pencil.
You now have something to do. You are not bored anymore. Having some writing/drawing materials makes a big difference.</description>
