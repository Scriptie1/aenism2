      <description>We are seeing increasingly advanced AI and robotics coming out of labs all around the world. I first saw ASIMO in the late 1990s and QRIO in the early 2000s, I was amazed by robotic bipedalism. Twenty years forward, though we are seeing much better locomotion and facial expressions are starting to look a little less creepy and we are definitely in a robotic age, I believe we are still at its dawn.</description>

      <description>The widely accepted notion of taste is of a sociological concept defined as a person&amp;rsquo;s personal and cultural patterns of preference. Of what looks good and what is cool. Is there an objective measure of beauty? How does taste work?
Taste or more accurately aesthetic taste is emotional. It&amp;rsquo;s the ability to discern the pleasant and the polar opposite of the emotion of disgust. Like the other senses, we perceive pleasance, beauty and goodness as sensory signals.</description>
