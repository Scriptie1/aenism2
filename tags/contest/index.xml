      <description>Introducing Designer News for the iPhone. Nothing more, nothing less but the full DN experience.
 Scroll, tap and swipe. Gimmick-free interface not just for designers, and that&amp;rsquo;s a good thing.
 Content that fits. One of the few entries that feature landscape orientation.
  PS: This isn&amp;rsquo;t the official DN app. It&amp;rsquo;s my entry for the Design+Code Giveaway contest organized by LayerVault. I started using LayerVault because of this contest and I have to say it&amp;rsquo;s much better suited for a design workflow than Dropbox.</description>
