      <description>6degrees Initially available on Android and now on iOS, 6degrees is a self-updating phonebook that automatically cleans duplicates and backs itself up. One of the first things I did for 6degrees was to refresh their identity.
6degrees is named after the popular theory originally set out by Frigyes Karinthy and popularized by a play written by John Guare â€“ that everyone and everything is six or fewer steps away, by way of introduction, from any other person in the world.</description>
