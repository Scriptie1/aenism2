            <p>Imagine.</p>
<p>You are in an empty white room. Just you in a stark, small empty space. With nothing to do, nothing to entertain yourself with. You fall asleep eventually only to wake up to the same bleakness as before.</p>
<p>Imagine.</p>
<p>Now an empty notebook appears in front of you. Then a pencil.</p>
<p>You now have something to do. You are not bored anymore. Having some writing/drawing materials makes a big difference. You can now journal your thoughts, draw your imagination and document world-changing ideas you are going to implement when you get out.</p>
<p class="lead">You don't live in this white room.</p>
<p>Your world is at least a million times more interesting than an empty room with some writing materials. So quit thinking there isn&rsquo;t enough external stimuli. If you are constantly searching for external solutions to boredom, perhaps you need to start looking inside.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>All sorrow has its root in man&rsquo;s inability to sit quiet in a room by himself.</em> â€” Blaise Pascal</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Next time you feel bored. Think of the white room.</p>
