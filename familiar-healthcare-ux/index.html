<p>MyDoc is a health brand with partners including leading global insurers AXA and AIA, and regional pharmaceutical retailer Guardian Pharmacy (Mannings in other regions). Started in 2012 in Singapore, MyDoc aims to integrates all aspects of healthcare into an easy-to-use platform which connects employers, governments and patients to doctors, pharmacies, insurers and laboratories.</p>

<p>Dr Snehal Patel, CEO and Co-Founder of MyDoc was introduced to me by an investor back in 2013 to help drive design in a then fledgling company. After a brief consulting stint I came on onboard as their <em>chief design guy at large</em> in 2014. I have since been part of the core product team and actively drive both product and design.</p>

<p>Working closely with the Head of Product, I have designed user-friendly user interface components in a healthcare-centric context, improved on design compliance by introducing audits and style guides and championed chat and AI as a means of interaction with the services offered by platform.</p>

<h2 id="healthcare-ui">Healthcare UI</h2>

<p>Healthcare software wrestle with many of the same challenges as other software but also confronts challenges unique to healthcare. Looking at what&rsquo;s popular on the App Store and Google Play, one can safely assume most designers are working on social networking, chat and e-commerce. Although the Health and Fitness category is a hot space, most of those product aren&rsquo;t meant for patients.</p>

<h3 id="chat-as-interface">Chat-as-interface</h3>

<p>One of the key evolutions of the MyDoc patient app is the use of chat as the primary interaction. With the prevalence of chat and instant messaging apps, the average user spends of the time on their device messaging. It&rsquo;s easy to assume and fall into the trap that we should just replace everything with chat. Fortunately with MyDoc, we are already having patients chat with their doctors for consultations and reviews, it&rsquo;s a natural progression that we enhance that experience to encompass more facets of total healthcare.</p>

<h4 id="enhanced-chat-bubbles">Enhanced Chat Bubbles</h4>

<p>I expanded on common enhanced chat bubbles found in other chat apps with healthcare-centric one to help patient quickly and accurately respond to doctor questions.</p>

<p>More structured bubbles are used to convey more complex information, such as scheduled events, and link previews.</p>

<h4 id="reply-suggestion">Reply Suggestion</h4>

<p>Preset replies are suggested to users as a quick way to respond to questions with predictable and expected answers, and to save typing.</p>

<h3 id="custom-scheduler">Custom Scheduler</h3>

<p>Patients on MyDoc are able to schedule video calls with doctors. A typical doctor&rsquo;s appointment slot is fifteen to sixty minutes in duration. In typical scheduling software, one time slot does not overlap with another. For example and for simplicity, a doctor&rsquo;s day starts at 9 AM and ends at 3 PM and his consults are an hour long. Most schedulers handle this by creating six one-hour slots for:</p>

<pre>
 9 AM – 10 AM
10 AM – 11 AM
11 AM – 12 PM
12 PM –  1 PM
 1 PM –  2 PM
 2 PM –  3 PM
</pre>

<p>The problem with this approach is the lack of flexibility. Being able to pick a 10:30 AM – 11:30 AM slot would be really helpful. This makes it fair for both patients and doctors. I strongly believe healthcare should be patient-centric. No more forcing sick people to a doctor&rsquo;s schedule.</p>

<h2 id="design-compliance">Design Compliance</h2>

<p>The best intentions of product and design are going to fall short if those building it are not sticking to the vision. Thus a big part of my work involves the effective communication of design specifications to the engineering team.</p>

<h3 id="design-styleguide">Design Styleguide</h3>

<p>I created the MyDoc design styleguide as the bible for all things design, as the page for the product and engineering teams to <em>be on the same page</em> on. The styleguide details important topics like design language, visual design, user flows, specifications for views and components, and personas.</p>

<h3 id="communicating-specifications">Communicating Specifications</h3>

<p>The stylguide governs product design at a broad level. When it comes to the nitty gritty, we rely on a tool like Zeplin and good&rsquo;ol design audits.</p>

<p>There are many aspects of my work with MyDoc I have not discussed, such as designing on Android, desktop, offline media and service design. Feel free to <a href="/contact/">contact me</a> if you want to know more.</p>
