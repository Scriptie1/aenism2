<p><em>This problem can be solved by children in five to ten minutes, programmers in an hour and people with higher education…</em></p>

<p>Have you seen the Bollywood film <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3_Idiots"><em>3 Idiots</em></a>? Here&rsquo;s the funny space pen scene from it.</p>

<p>True story or not, this scene propones the folly of complex solutions to simple problems. How many times have we caught ourselves inventing space pens?</p>
<p>Chil­dren we once were, grow­ing up was largely about maturing psychologically into adults. Respon­si­bility, paying the bills, getting things done and various complexities we call adult­hood. To come of age was to lose our tantrums, silli­ness and innocence. Hence started the displacement of our childly minds.</p>
<p>The artless mind of a child is our great­est gift. As embryos in our moth­ers, our heart is the first organ to develop only to power the next – the seedling brain which will eventually make a quar­ter of a mil­lion new neu­rons every minute. By the age of ten, each of us would have made bil­lions and bil­lions of neural con­nec­tions. It is a super­charged engine for learn­ing and cre­ativ­ity. Yet by adult­hood we would have <a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/ken_robinson_says_schools_kill_creativity.html">displaced most of this creativity</a>. The adult mind thinks too much. Its thoughts too influ­enced by knowl­edge. We must regain the ability to think like kids again.</p>
<p>Quora is a knowledgeable community. Admist the clever answers one often finds over­thinking and com­pli­cation from people triyng to look smart. <a href="http://www.quora.com/What-is-the-easiest-way-to-cut-a-pizza-into-11-equal-slices">How would you cut a pizza into 11 pieces?</a></p>
<p>The pop­u­lar answers to the ques­tion involved cal­cu­la­tions with com­passes, con­cen­tric cir­cles, Pythagorean the­o­rem and square roots until someone suggested <a href="http://www.quora.com/What-is-the-easiest-way-to-cut-a-pizza-into-11-equal-slices/answer/Aen-Tan">a solution using strings</a>, something not hard to find in a kitchen. I had no idea what a con­cen­tric cir­cle is, let alone pizza cooks. And who keeps com­passes in a kitchen?</p>
<p>The simple string solution involves first cir­cling then cutting a string around the pizza&rsquo;s cir­cum­fer­ence. The string is then wrapped eleven times around one&rsquo;s thumb and index finger until one gets eleven equal divisions by trial and error. The divisions are then marked. Cir­cle the string around the pizza again and cut from center to the markings. What simplicity! The answer soon became a rated as <em>best source</em>.</p>

<p>Con­jur­ing math­e­mat­i­cal mumbo jumbo may make one look smart. To be truly cre­ative one needs to be able to lib­er­ate the mind from accumulated grown-up banality. Only then the child mind re-emerges.</p>
<h2 id="answer-to-the-numbers-question">Answer to the numbers question</h2>
<p>The ques­tion has noth­ing to do with math­e­mat­ics. Look for the closed loops or shapes in each num­ber and count them. In 0, 6, 8 and 9. 8 has two of them. 2581 has two. The answer is 2.</p>
